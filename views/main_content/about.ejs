            <p>
                I'm a second year Networking and IT Security student.
                I was born in Canada, but grew up in the Netherlands. <br>
                <br>
                When it comes to programming, I much prefer backend-programming.
                I can code in all programming languages, though I have the most experience in Java and Python.<br>
                <br>
                In my free time, I enjoy playing music. I play bass guitar, piano, and flute.
                I enjoy jamming with other musicians, and also performing. <br>
                <br>
                Below is a video of me skating with friends :)
